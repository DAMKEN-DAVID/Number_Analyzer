# Number_Analyzer
Rust program that analyzes a series of numbers. The program should:

Create an array of 10 integer numbers of your choice.
Implement a function is_even(n: i32) -> bool that returns true if a number is even, false otherwise.
Use a for loop to iterate through the array and for each number:
Print whether it's even or odd using your is_even function
If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead
If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead
If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
Use a while loop to find and print the sum of all numbers in the array.
Use a loop to find and print the largest number in the array.
